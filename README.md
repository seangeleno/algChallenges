# Heroes and Villains Challenge

_Heroes and Villains_ is a teambuilding exercise whereby players
each randomly (secretly) select a hero and a villain from among
the other players. Traditionally, each player then tries to
simulteaneously get as far as possible from their chosen
villain while getting as close as possible to their hero. However,
in our variant, we don't really care too much about distance. No,
see, in our variant, you have to line up your hero in between your
villain and yourself.

Now obviously, you can't move your hero or villain; you can only
move yourself. Therefore, the only way to line up your hero in
between yourself and your villain is to find the line between your
hero and villain, then to get yourself onto or near said line on
the side of your hero.
