This is a directory dedicated to mixing STL with my own defined data structures.  I wanted to explore the STL because I think it is a very helpful tool in rapid prototyping.  Also, OOP concepts I wasn't necessarily up to speed on were developed more extensively here.  virtual, pure virtual (and necessarily overloading), and dynamic casting were all used to explore a "Tree"(contains connections across it if the user defines them).  The data the tree stores is taxonomic info. I'm going to aim for Phyllum receiving precedence in tree location (pushing it up if defined after the family nodes, for example), but for right now, HashNode and StringNode are both able to be used regardless of defined order at runtime. That being said, the application of the program was defined AFTER I completed it really. So its more just an after thought to exploring those concepts I mentioned earlier.
